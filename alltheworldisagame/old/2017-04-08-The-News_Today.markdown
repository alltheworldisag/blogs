**Results of the US-China meeting**

Nothing. I've read some news and op-ed pieces about the Trump-Xi meeting and the headlines are something like "No breakthrough", "Getting to know each other", nothing interesting.  I couldnt parse any information out of the [People's Daily ](http://en.people.cn/)either.  
<!--excerpt-->
China is wise.  They hold all the cards.  American corporations will not allow their investments in China to be thrown away, so China need not worry about economic sanctions, penalties or tariffs. The South China sea islands are well in hand and the US is not going to try and seize them.  North Korea is a Chinese tool to aggravate and test US Presidents and keep them busy, nothing to worry about there.  And Syria is progressing the way China wants but even if it doesnt, do they care?  China is moving on from the US - their One Belt One Road (OBOR) initiative of reviving the old land and maritime Silk Road trade routes means they are focusing on the Eurasia landmass for their growth rather than the US.  In twenty years the US will not be their greatest trading partner.   
My guess is that China will humour Donald Trump, play to his ego and give him some attention and positive words.  Their plans stretch longer than the 4-year cycles of US Presidential elections and they probably don't care who is in the whitehouse.  China can sit back and enjoy seeing the US bogged down in the Middle East forever. The Israelis will eventually cost the US it's Empire.  

**Syria Updates**

Was the chemical attack all theatre?  And was the response as well?  MoonOfAlabama has a [great post](http://www.moonofalabama.org/2017/04/trumps-khan-sheikoun-production.html#more "MoA: Khan Sheikoun show was Trump's Production") describing why it seems the footage from the chemical attack was just too perfect - Hollywood perfect - to be real and the response from the US was too small to be meaningful.  The post asserts that the real reason behind it all was to get the Neocons off President Trump's back.  Now that they have all lined up to support him, he can get on with business.  But for how long?  It's not as though Neo-cons have any trouble flip-flopping. And Trump has shown them how they can get him to act.  The next "chemical attack" will be a lot bigger. 
What if he just held his ground against the Neocons - didn't reinforce them at all? His previous failures on Healthcare were not because of them but from his own lack of management and preparedness and understanding of Congress. He could continue to try and improve his legislative performance, rack up some wins on the border wall and other issues and improve his Presidency without caving or even pretending to cave to the Neocons.
