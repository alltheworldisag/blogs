<p><strong><em>Summary of Press Conference</em></strong></p>

<p>Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov held a press conference after a lengthy five hours of talks as well as an additional two hours that included President Vladamir Putin. Thier opening speeches and responses to reporters reflected their countries views and also their character.  Mr. Tillerson repeated talking points, made accusations and threats without evidence or rationale using few words with little depth and Mr. Lavrov provided a logical analysis, including context and history, without violating diplomatic conventions and steering clear of accusation.  Mr. Tillerson represents the views of the US Empire - an entity which feels it’s actions can force a reality that it seeks and sees little need in explaining itself since it can co-erce and lie with impunity - wheras Mr. Lavrov represents a country, not an empire, motivated by clear national interests.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>Questions were put forth by Russia 24, Ria Novosti, the Associated Press, Fox News and CBS news.  The American reporters asked questions that assumed President Assad was some sort of outlaw or monster.  They repeated a previous reference to him as being an “animal” and asked about whether he would be charged with war crimes and patronized Lavrov with questions about what it would take for  Russia to stop supporting him. Rex Tillerson said that “as time goes by more and more evidence comes out” about how Assad used chemical weapons.  Mr. Lavrov requested actual evidence multiple times during his answers but none were forthcoming.</p>

<p>Mr. Lavrov found it suspicious that the chemical attack occured on the same day that a UN-sponsored and Russia-backed peace conference was supposed to start.  He called out the White Helmets as being propogandists for Al-Qaeda and behind all the accusations. He challenged the US Empire and UN to start an objective investigation to uncover the facts.  He stated he was 100% certain that no evidence would be found and any delay or reluctance in establishing such a probe would reflect poorly on the honesty and intentions of the US Empire and UN.  Mr. Lavrov went on to remind the audience about all the failures of the US Empire in attempted regime change: Sudan, Yugoslavia, Afghanistan, Iraq and now possibly Syria.  Regarding Syria he said:  “We know how this ends”.</p>

<p>Mr. Tillerson spoke without honesty or integrity and often ventured into hypocrisy.  He spoke of how the “world” wouldn’t accept Assad remaining in power - by “world” he meant the “US Empire”.  He complained that President Assad had used “cluster weapons”, the same weapons that the US itself has been providing to Israel for many decades and that were dropped on Lebanese civilians in 2006.  On the topic of alleged Russian interference into the US elections, Tillerson said that interference had been “well established” and it was “serious enough to attract additional sanctions”.  This despite the fact that the alleged interference was to help Trump become elected, hence providing Tillerson with his job as Secretary of State. Regardless, Tillerson brought no evidence. Lavrov was not impressed: “we have not seen any facts or hints at facts” and “these [accusations] are just games”.</p>

<p>Mr. Tillerson’s performance during the press conference reminded this writer of a sequence on the old CNN show called Crossfire. The episode aired during the run-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. While debating the issue, the host Tucker Carlson told a French official that if they did not support the US in it’s invasion of Iraq, the US might sanction them - then held up a bottle of French wine to make his point.  The Frenchman quipped “if you sanction our wines, the only one that will be hurt are wine lovers.”  The audience laughed and Carlson started frothing at the mouth and repeated some tired statements about the strained relationship between the US and France.  He could not be gracious; it would have been better for him to say “touche”. Tillerson looked like Carlson.  He looked like a man who was beaten in a debate, did not have the grace to admit it, instead repeating talking points with a forceful frown, trying to look tough and serious.</p>

<p><strong><em>Notes from the press conference</em></strong></p>

<p>Q &amp; A:
Russia 24: Contradictory statements about Syria’s Assad, exaggerations about Assad. How can rhetoric change?  Tillerson: double-down on chemical weapons claim and expanded to chlorine and “cluster weapons”.  Lavrov: Need objective investigation and reminded all about previous efforts to remove chemical weapons from Syria. Repeated claim chemical weapons were in the areas of the extremists. All accusations against SAA are from not-credible sources such as the White Helmets – they are guilty of fraud. On the other hand, Russia provided real pyshical evidence of the presence of chemical weapons in the areas of the extremists. It is interesting that the chemical weapons were used on the same day as the conference about Syria (in Geneva?).  Lavrov not convinced at all that chemical weapons were used - 100% sure that if an investigation from the UN is  not started it will prove that they are hiding something. Lengthy response compared to Tillerson.</p>

<p>AP: How will the US engage a political process with Assad that requires his ouster? War crimes charges? Any things got cleared up between Russia and US?  Tillerson: repeated statements of Assad’s “conduct over past few years” that his family must go in an orderly way.  The world won’t accept that.  As time goes by and “more and more evidence comes out” Assad may face war crimes charges.  Lavrov: Russia and the US are not at such a great distance that they cannot be crossed.  Rex says he’s a “new guy and doesnt want to look into matters of history” but it is necessary to learn from the past. Brought up the Serbian war, TV station being bombed, shelling of residential areas, Chinese embassy, infrastrucure targetted until they “run out of targets”.  Saddam Husseing was hanged, we know how this invasion was started, Tony Blair repented publicly said it was “a fake”, Ghadaffi was removed , it was said democracy would prevail. Now look the Libyan state doesn’t exist.  Russia is trying to help bring it to and end.  Other examples from longer ago … Omar Bashir in Sudan, Sudan split into two parts. Bashir held up his end of the bargain, and then US put sanctions on the country they helped to create.  “We know how this ends”.  The successful ouster of a dictator … if you have any successful examples, I’d like to hear it.  Syria … we are not trying to support anyone, Assad or anyone.  We want them all at the same table, an inter-Syrian dialogue.  It’s important not to eliminate any leader - everyone must be represented.</p>

<p>Fox News:  Were sanctions vs a “change in behaviour from the Russian government” discussed?  If Assad is found guilty will you stop supporting him or will you support him in any case?  Tillerson: No change in sanctions, interference in election has been established, “serious enough to attract additional sanctions”, Lavrov: no threat of new sanctions, repeated call for independent investigation into chemical attacks - “priniciple of innoncent until proven guilty must be respected”, “we have not seen any facts or hints at facts” about evidence of interference in elections. “these are just games”.</p>

<p>Rio Novosti: The US sent a strike group with aircraft carrier, what risks? Does this signify that the US has plans for military intervention?</p>

<p>CBS News: To tillerson: you said Russia was incompetent or clueless about chemical attacks. To Lavrov: Trump called Assad an animal, how long will you back him? Tillerson: no evidence that Russia was involved, we have firm evidence that Assad did it. Lavrov: I can only say once again just as in the case of supposed Russian hackers, we would like to see concrete evidence, we have not seen any.  We are acting in Syria at the request of it’s legitamite government.  We are fighting ISIS. Obama did almost nothing until Russia airspace forces were deployed.  After, they only striked against ISIS and not Al-Nusra.  We hope the people will prevail who know how to learn for history.  There will be time for everything but we have heard new priorities from the US that ISIS is the more serious threat and no need to oust Assad.  Kerry said so too.  We (US and Russia) think along same lines. If we oust the regime we might not win agains ISIS&gt;</p>
