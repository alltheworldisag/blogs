<p><strong><em>China’s Strategy</em></strong></p>

<p>Recent movements by the US and Russia in Syria present opportunities and challenges for China. Russia has emerged as a military power that rivals the American Empire in technology and sophistication.  Russia has also shown by it’s moves in Syria and Ukraine that it is willing to take the risk of confronting the Empire militarily while protecting its own interests.  Russia cannot be an Empire even if it wanted to because it’s politics is dominated by a nationalist orientation as opposed to an idealogy as was the case with the old Soviet Union.  It builds coalitions to protect it’s interest through military cooperation and sales of defense equipment.  From this perspective, one goal of the recent strike by the US Empire with Tomahawk cruise missiles on a Syrian air base was clearly to show that the Empire can penetrate airspace guarded by Russia’s S-400 anti-aircraft systems - in case any country was considering buying them as a means of defense against the Empire.</p>

<!--excerpt-->

<p>China is also not an Empire and cannot put together alliances and coalitions to defend it’s national interest through military cooperation because it does not possess technology like Russia and the Empire have.  China is instead an economic power.  It’s economic clout is akin to Russia’s military power.  Chinese moves to advance it’s interests and compete with the Empire usually come in the economic field.</p>

<p>China is a mercantilist nation.  It’s aim is profit and prosperity in all its transactions. China eschews war as it is not profitable.  With its One Belt One Road (OBOR) project China aims to take its economic achievements viz a viz it’s trade relationship with the US to a higher, post-US plane.  China’s goal is to invest in Eurasian infrastructure and make inter-Eurasion trade at least as important as China-US or China-EU trade.  As such, China wants to be seen as benevolent and unbiased, with its OBOR project “<a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0416/c90000-9203447.html" title="People Daily">delivering benefits to the world</a>”.</p>

<p>It is logical then for China to keep out of military conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.  As well, China does not currently support the inclusion of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)  probably because it does not want to be seen as entering an alliance with Russia and Iran against the Empire.  Having such a reputation would not fit with and indeed harm its global trade agenda.</p>

<p>Predictably, China had no response to the rudeness of President Trump’s ordering the missile strike on Syria when President Xi was visiting Washington.  Instead, Chinese editorials praised the meeting as productive and evidence of cooperation between China and the US.  This image of cooperation is vital to China’s strategy.</p>

<p>Together, China and Russia do form a considerable threat to the position of the Empire on the global chessboard since one is a military giant and the other an economic giant.  Under Obama, the Empire decided to attack Russia by wresting Ukraine out of it’s sphere of influence and imposing sanctions. Trump’s election at first signalled a change in strategy; the Empire would make friends with Russia and attack China economically by threatening trade wars.  This fit with Trump and his supporters complaints of a lack of manufacturing jobs in the US and Trump’s racial preference for white nations over non-white nations. The Empire’s deep state seems to have conviced Trump otherwise and now Trump’s foreign policy is a continuation of Obama’s.</p>

<p>Under Trump, the Empire launched an attack on the Syrian airbase, has publicly threatened Iran and Russia and made pubic its plans to invade Syria with ground troops.  Russia has responded by holding firm to its position in Syria, its alliance with Iran and verbally battling the Empire for the moral highground in the conflict.</p>

<p>What is China’s response?  Given China’ strengths and strategy, getting involved militarily in Syria or even seeming to support one side would endanger its vital trade interests.  China’s response is to continue promoting OBOR and generally global free trade.  Todays editorial in the state mouthpiece The People “<a href="http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0420/c90000-9205581.html">The U.S. should get more buddy-buddy with China</a>” echoes this point.</p>

<p>China promotes a soft image of a peacful economic powerhouse.  The Empire, through its adventures in destroying Arab countries and its moral browbeating at the hands of Russia (see Tillerson in Russia) is busy ruining its own repuation.  This is an opportunity for China to push OBOR and effectively say to the world that the Empire only ruins but does not build.  China does, via OBOR.  Similarly, the Empire’s missteps in the Middle East have given Russia an opening to say to the world that they can protect threatened states against the Empire militarily.  This is why it is so important to the Empire to sign TPP to prove to Asian countries that the Empire is still open for business (you’ll see a push for Trump to flip-flop on TPP soon) and for the Empire to defeat Russia militarily in Syria.  If these two things do not happen the Empire will lose some if it’s power:</p>

<p>1) Russia will become a military rival again, providing the world’s nations with an alternative to the US Empire in terms of security.</p>

<p>2) OBOR will provide Asian nations with an alternative means of ecomonic development which does not include trade with the US Empire.</p>

<p>Given China’s economic strengths and its goals (OBOR, continued trade with US and EU) it wants to avoid any interruption in global trade and this position is clear from Chinese editorials and responses to flare-ups in Syria.  It also wants Russia and Iran to win in Syria but cannot get involved without hurting itself economically.  As long as Russia and Iran are willing to confront the US Empire in the Middle East, China does not need to do anything except focus on it’s own development.  China’s position on the global chessboard must be the envy of all other nations.</p>
