The US-Empire made it's move yesterday indirectly attacking Iran by trying to remove one of it's supporters (not quite allies) from the Middle-Eastern chessboard.  The move may have been instigated by Saudi Arabia but the recent visit to that country by Donald Trump and his administration's blatant anti-Iran bias make it certain that the US was itself involved in the plan.

***Turkish response***


Turkey has met with the Foreign Minister of Iran.  No details were released but it is not a coincedence that they met at this time.  They spoke of gathering for a "High Level Cooperation Council meeting" soon. Considering the timing, it speaks of a new cooperation between Iran and Turkey. Elsewhere it is being reported that [Turkey has thrown it's weight behind Qatar](https://www.rferl.org/a/turkey-iran-back-qatar-dispute-saudi-arabia-other-arab-states/28535012.html) by sending troops and supplies.

***Russian response***


Russian FM Lavrov has scheduled a meeting with Qatari FM Al-Thani on Saturday.  The fact that this meeting was set up before any meeting with US President Trump shows quite clearly where Qatar's loyalties lie.  Despite hosting 10,000 American troops, Qatar seems oddly on the the Russia/Iran axis rather than with the US-Empire.  It seems the countries which are developing a political Islam such as Turkey and Iran have more in common with Qatar (sponsor of the Muslim Brotherhood) than with other Arab Kingdoms.  
Russia does not seem to have taken a side yet.  Their words on the crisis do not indicate that they will committ anything to help Qatar. Lavrov spoke of the need for ["require consolidation rather than separation"](https://ria.ru/world/20170608/1496094608.html) in fighting terrorism. 

***Analysis***



Qatar is not capitulating - far from it.  It has powerful friends, money and doesn't seem to mind bucking the trends of the GCC.  What will happen next?  How can Qatar move towards Iran/Russia when they host 10,000 US troops?  The support Qatar has already recieved gives it breathing room to negotiate with Saudi Arabia and the UAE.  In the end, my guess would be that Iran would lose something in this confrontation.  Iran is what this is all about anyways.  The demands put upon Qatar are all fake, if they agree to distance themselves from Iran, then this whole show will end.
