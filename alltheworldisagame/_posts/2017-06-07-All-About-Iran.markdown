***It's All About Iran***

The US Empire is on the offensive.  On June 6th, it struck a Syrian military target around the At-tanf border crossing which re-affirmed its positoin as occupier of southeastern Syria. On the same day, it's client, Saudi Arabia led a total embargo on Qatar for wanting better relations with Iran. On June 7th, a terrorist attack targeted the parliament in Tehran. This last one could not have been a coincidence, it must have been coordinated with the other two to send a message to Iran:  the Empire is coming after you. Logically, one would expect this sort of action since the Trump administration is packed with Iran hawks.  It was just a matter of time, and now it begins. 

<!--excerpt-->

Under the Obama administration, an attempt was made to distance the Empire from Sunni despots like Hosni Mubarak in Egypt and the King of Saudi Arabia and to pivot towards a Iran with the Nuclear deal.  Now under Trump, these dictators have been embraced, supplied with weapons and directed at Iran. 

***Analysis***

These three attacks are generally bad news for Iran since they herald a period in which the US Empire is going on the offensive wheras it was Iran and Russia that had been on the offensive for several years in Iraq and Syria.  

The Syrian military wants the At-tanf border crossing but in order to get it, they will need Russian and Iranian help.  So far, we have not seen any sign that Russia is willing to committ serious military hardware such as jets or anti-aircraft missiles to provide cover for the Syrian military.  The Empire is winning this battle but the strategic value of At-tanf is questionable. Iran does not need the At-tanf crossing to communicate with it's allies in Damascus or Beirut although it would be helpful to them.  For years, the built up Hezbollah and had a cooperative relationship with the Syrian government at a time when the whole of Iraq was a no-go zone for Iran. The Empire's rationale to stop Iran/Syria from getting this border point is probably to deny a resource rather than the impossible goal of cutting Iran off from it's allies.

Qatar is in a tough spot.  The embargo placed upon them creates huge problems for their economy and the list of 10 demands from Saudi Arabia to lift the embargo is humiliating and impossible to implement.  Qatar is on the verge of being invaded by Saudi Arabia and is hoping for Turkish support.  If Qatar is eliminated by Saudi Arabia, it will not have much effect on the ground in Syria.  It will remove a neutral power from the GCC and thus bias that organization towards a completely anti-Iran line. On the other hand, if Qatar survives this, the GCC is effectively broken.  Saudi Arabia has made huge gambles recently: crashing the price of oil, starting a war in Yemen and now embargoing Qatar.  The first two did not work and probably the third won't either. Everything hinges on Turkish and Iranian support of Qatar in the next few days.  

President Trump is keen to create an anti-Iran alliance among Sunni despotic regimes and is willing to give Saudi Arabia all the weapons it needs to do so. This has been tried before - the US supported Saddam Hussein to attack Iran in 1980 which had disastrous consquences for both sides but the war was eventually won by Iran.  Iran went on to become a regional power while Iraq was eventually obliterated.  It is unlikely that the leadership in Washington will learn from history and putting any policy, especially a war policy, in the hands of Saudi Arabia is sure to backfire badly.
