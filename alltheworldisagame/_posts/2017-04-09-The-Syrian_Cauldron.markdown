A [short statement by the Kremlin](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/54256 "Kremlin: Telephone conversation with President of Iran Rouhani") today re-affirmed the Russia-Iran military alliance in Syria and promised to "boost these efforts to ensure stability and security in the Middle East."  [A statement by Ayatollah Khamenei](http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/54256 "Khamenei: The US made a strategic mistake") described the US strike against the Syrian government as a strategic mistake. It's not much information but it speaks volumes by what it doesn't say: no softening of words, just solidification of current positions.

Howerver, the US Empire's MSM propoganda is going into over-drive, providing cover for a significant move possibly. The MSM reported what seems to be a [fake statement](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-mideast-crisis-syria-allies-idUSKBN17B0K7 "Reuters: Assad allies say US attack crossed red lines") by Russia and Iran saying that the US crossed red lines in their attack and that Russia and Iran will respond the next time. The tag line for the reuters piece is from Amman, Jordan - a pawn of the US Empire with exactly zero sovereignty.  No confirmation from Russia or Iran.  Russia Insider originally reported it then [called it fake and retracted their story](http://russia-insider.com/en/breaking-russia-and-iran-say-they-will-respond-force-if-us-strikes-syria-again/ri19518 "Reuters, Others, Report Fake Iran/Russia Statement on Syria â€” 'Russia Insider' Blindly Follows").  

Next propaganda piece:  [The MSM is reporting that ISIS attacked a US base in southern Syria](https://www.wsj.com/articles/islamic-state-hits-u-s-led-base-in-southern-syria-1491769112 "WSJ: Islamic State Hits U.S.-Led Base in Southern Syria"). ISIS has never attacked a US base and why would they when the US is taking out the Syrian Government forces? This fake news was reported to head off any conclusions that the public may make that the US and ISIS are in collusion. 

Next piece:  Al-jazeera (owned by Qatar - a leading sponsor Syrian rebels) has reported that [the SAA used white phosphorous against Syrian rebels](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-09/isis-attacks-us-led-base-southern-syria-assad-said-use-white-phosphorus "ZH: assad said to use white phosphorous").  Why would he do that?? Does he want to drag the US into war?  Of course it is just a lie. 

Something big is coming.  [Lindsay Graham was on Tucker Carlson (Fox News) ](http://video.foxnews.com/v/5390333936001/?playlist_id=2280180753001#sp=show-clips "Fox")lavishing praise on Trump every moment he got - often being cut-off by Carlson.  He was calling for 8k troops in Syria.  The pressure is piling on Trump to invade Syria.  A report from Russia Insider credited to independent journalist Mike Cernovich states [NatSec Adisor McMaster is trying to sell Trump on a plan for 150K troops in Syria](http://russia-insider.com/en/breaking-trumps-national-security-adviser-wants-full-scale-war-syria/ri19516 "RI:Trump's National Security Advisor Planning 'Full-Scale War' in Syria"). The whitehouse is considering [to apply more sanctions on Syria and Russia](http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/327920-graham-to-expand-russia-sanctions-bill-to-include-aiding-assad "The Hill: Graham to expand Russia sanctions bill to include aiding Assad")  (how can they apply more than they have already?). Interesting that they are leaving Iran out.  Is this how they will apply pressure and split the resistance - body slam Russia and provide Boeing airplanes to Iran? How will Iran and Russia respond?
