*How will the 'yes' vote in the Turkish referendum affect it's role in the American Empire?*

It is well known that the current Turkish President Recep Tayipp Erdogan is sufficiently disliked by the US and EU that a coup was staged against him which he narrowly escaped.  Obviously, he will now become the President of Turkey for the forseeable future and on the surface that makes for trouble with Washington.  However, each new administration brings a new foreign policy and President Trump was the first Western leader to congratulate Erdogan.   

<!--excerpt-->

American foreign policy is fickle and changes quickly, what matters more is the direction Erdogan will take Turkey now.  Even if Trump accepts the referendum, Turkish accession to the EU is dead, judging from the reaction of European countries - not that it was ever possible in the first place or even wanted by the Turkish side.  

One line of thinking is that Turkey under Erdogan wishes to be a leader by creating a Sunni coalition and gathering all Sunni countries under it's leadership as the Shia are led by Iran. The old parliamentary system in Turkey [created too many crises](https://www.dailysabah.com/columns/fahrettin-altun/2017/04/22/western-losers-clubs-misconception-of-turkey "Western losers' club's misconception of Turkey") and the new Presidential system is thought to be more stable and strong and able to keep up with Turkey's lofty ambitions. 

The Presidential system is actually a lot like the American system. The new Presidency in Turkey will be able to:

1) Appoint and dismiss cabinent members

2) Retain party membership

3) Run for two consecutive 5 year terms

4) Introduce legislation such as the budget

5) Make certain laws by decree

6) Appoint members of the judiciary

All of these powers are possessed by the America president. The only major difference is the 5 year terms which seem to be an improvement on the American system. 

If Turkey is to be strong, stable and able lead it's own Sunni coalition, then the American Empire is weakened by the Turkish referendum because Turkey will run indepently of the foreign policy of the Empire and it will actually compete for influence among Sunni muslim countries with the Empire.  Russia is already competing so this may create a three-way race.  Rather than compete for influence in new states, the America Empire will have to spend energy keeping it's current clients as those clients now have options.  Egypt, for example, may have a choice between creating alliances with the US, Russia and Turkey.  

Turkey, like Iran have a long way to go to become true coalition leaders.  To successfully lead a coalition of countries requires military technology that neither currently posess.  But both countries are on that path and if they can remain politically stable they may reach it.
