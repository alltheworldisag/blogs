*How will the 'yes' vote in the Turkish referendum affect it's role in the American Empire?*

It is well known that the current Turkish President Recep Tayipp Erdogan is sufficiently disliked by the US and EU that a coup was staged against him which he narrowly escaped.  Obviously, he will now become the President of Turkey for the forseeable future and on the surface that makes for trouble with Washington.  However, each new administration brings a new foreign policy and President Trump was the first Western leader to congratulate Erdogan.   

<!--excerpt-->

American foreign policy is fickle and changes quickly, what matters more is the direction Erdogan will take Turkey now.  Even if Trump accepts the referendum, Turkish accession to the EU is dead, judging from the reaction of European countries - not that it was ever possible in the first place or even wanted by the Turkish side.  

One line of thinking is that Turkey under Erdogan wishes to be a leader by creating a Sunni coalition and gathering all Sunni countries under it's leadership as the Shia are led by Iran. The old parliamentary system in Turkey [created too many crises](https://www.dailysabah.com/columns/fahrettin-altun/2017/04/22/western-losers-clubs-misconception-of-turkey "Western losers' club's misconception of Turkey") and the new Presidential system is thought to be more stable and strong and able to keep up with Turkey's lofty ambitions. 

The Presidential system is actually a lot like the American system. The new Presidency in Turkey will be able to:

1) Appoint and dismiss cabinent members

2) Retain party membership

3) Run for two consecutive 5 year terms

4) Introduce legislation such as the budget

5) Make certain laws by decree, but can be overturned by Parliament. 

6) [Appoint members of the judiciary](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/order-from-chaos/2017/04/13/the-turkish-constitutional-referendum-explained/) 

(6 of 13 members of the High Council of Judges and Prosecutors (a body responsible for selecting new judges, prosecuters and promotions) will be appointed by the President.  Currently this body has 22 members with four appointed by the President. 
The consitutional court will have 15 members with 12 appointed by the President. It used to have 17 members with roughly the same composition.)


Most of these powers are possessed by the American President.  The big difference is that the judiciary is selected in ways completely different than the American system.  Some commentators have criticized the new system by saying it gives the President too much control over the appointment of judges. However, the history of Turkey shows that the judciary has often interfered in politics by banning political parties, thus thwarting the will of the people.  Imagine if in the US a President that won election was dissallowed because the Republican or Democratic party was banned!? The new system will prevent that since many judges are appointed by the President but not so many that the President has full control of the judiciary.  The President appoints a minority of the judges on the High Council and the President's role in appointments to the Constiutional court will not change much after the referendum. 

It seems to this observer that Turkish democracy is not threatened by the referendum.  The threat is the same as it has been for twenty years:  The opposition party (CHP) is inept. It is a liberal party and the leaders cannot put down their egos long enough to adjust the parties policies to fit mainstream Turkish society.  Therefore, they always lose and as a result Turkish society loses.  The AKP and its predecessors moved from the religious right to the conservative centre-right in order to capture  the support of the majority of the society. The CHP is unwilling to do that - probably still waiting to ride a military coup into power.  

If you imagine the Turkish government with Erdogan in power forever you would be right to be concerned.  But if a real oppostiion party arose in Turkey then this new Presidential system would not stop them from influencing laws, governance and public opinion.  It is the presence of an effective oppostion that is the real check and balance in a democratic system.  Turkey doesnt have one. 

If Turkey is to be strong, stable and able lead it's own Sunni coalition, then the American Empire is weakened by the Turkish referendum because Turkey will run indepently of the foreign policy of the Empire and it will actually compete for influence among Sunni muslim countries with the Empire.  Russia is already competing so this may create a three-way race.  Rather than compete for influence in new states, the American Empire will have to spend energy keeping it's current clients as those clients now have options.  Egypt, for example, may have a choice between creating alliances with the US, Russia and Turkey.  

Turkey, like Iran have a long way to go to become true coalition leaders.  To successfully lead a coalition of countries requires military technology that neither currently posess.  But both countries are on that path and if they can remain politically stable they may reach it.
