**Battleground Countries**

Whenever a signficant movement occurs in the world such as the Syrian war, it shakes up the order of things or at least threatens too.  Some Battleground countries may be tempted to switch sides or be convinced to remain on a particular side depending on how the movement ends.  
Clearly what we see now is a fight for Syria - the US Empire is trying to flip it over to their side even if they have to kill everyone there and Russia and Iran are trying to keep it on the Eurasian side. 
What are other countries doing?  Are they wobbling in their positions, threatening to change sides?  Let's look at Egypt today:

<!--excerpt-->

Egypt was once in the Soviet orbit but since it's devasting loss to Israel in th '67 war it has moved into the US Empire camp.  When the US chose not to support the dictator Hosni Mubarak during the Arab Spring pseudo-revolution, Egypt has since drifted away.  
Egypt's response to the US airstrike on Syria was very telling.  Other Sunni Arab countries were quick to signal their allegiance to the US Empire but Egypt took another course.  Their delegation to the UN [condemned the US attack on Syria and called for an end to the war](https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/egypt-defies-arab-league-condemn-syria-attack/ "Al-masdar: Egypt defies Arab League").  The day prior to the US attack, when there was an alleged chemical attack on Khan Sheikoun in Syria, the Egyptian delegation to the Security Council did not condemn the Syrian government and Al-Ahram closed it's [main article ](http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/262437/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-says-polarisation-in-UN-over-Idlib-attack-hu.aspx "Al-ahram: Egypt sayls polarization in UN ... hurst Syrian people")on the issue with quotes from the Syrian foreign ministry clearly showing whose side Egypt is on - in the current political environment in Egypt it's hard to believe a major paper like Al-ahram could stray from the governments line.  
A general theme in the news media lately is that Trump is trying to reset ties with Egypt. On Friday April 7th, Trump met Egyptian president El-Sisi during a five-day visit. During the visit El-Sisi met with IMF and World Bank officials as well.  In sum: Egypt is begging for money and that's their first priority.  On the surface it seems they are willing to continue being subservient to the US Empire as long as they get some finanical help but considering their response to the US attack on Syria, they are willing to stand independently too.  Perhaps they know that the US needs them for Israel's security and fears them moving to the Eurasia camp.  As it stands I would put the threat of Egypt changing sides as a very low probability since their main concern is financial problems.
