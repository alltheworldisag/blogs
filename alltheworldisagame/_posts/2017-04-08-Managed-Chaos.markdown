**US Empire and it's Managed Chaos Strategy**

In response to the 9/11 attack on NY, the US has embarked on a new type of foreign policy: managed chaos.  It's a term I read in an [article my Mike Whitney](http://www.unz.com/mwhitney/the-impending-clash-between-the-u-s-and-russia/ "UNZ: Impending clash between US and Russia"). Whitney quotes Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov saying that: 

<!--excerpt-->

"The concept of managed chaos appeared long ago as a method of strengthening US influence. Its basic premise is that managed chaos projects should be launched away from the United States in regions that are crucial for global economic and financial development. The Middle East has always been in the focus of politicians and foreign policy engineers in Washington. Practice has shown that this concept is dangerous and destructive, in particular for the countries where the experiment was launched, namely Iraq, Libya, Syria, Yemen and Afghanistan…In Iraq, Syria and Libya, this chaos was created intentionally.

…Responsible politicians have come to see that the managed chaos theory is destroying life in many regions. Some parties can benefit in the short term from fluctuations on the raw materials markets provoked by the revolutions orchestrated by external forces, but this theory ultimately backfires at its engineers and executors in the form of massive migration inflows, which terrorists use to enter these countries. We can see this in Europe. Terrorist attacks have been staged even in the United States. The Atlantic Ocean has not protected it from the terrorist threat. This is the boomerang effect.”

The US is punishing Arab countries for 9/11 by destroying all of them and leaving them in ruins.  Perhaps it expects that it can direct and shape the chaos into something desireable to itself. However, the chaos is bringing violence to the West, especially the EU. The mass immigration it causes is leading to political shifts in the EU that will in the end have negative implications for the EU itself and the US.  The rise of nationalism means that each EU country will be more indpendent-minded and harder to control.  Some may even see their future in Eurasia rather than with the US Empire. 

Managed chaos is also creating opportunities for Russia and Iran to flip countries away from the US Empire (e.g Iraq, Turkey). It also creates a raison d'etre for Russia and Iran's alliance and a hardening of their positions.  Both countries and China as well have real fear over the spread of terrorist groups and the chaos they bring - all enabled by US weaponry.  These countries then start banding together and coordinating on how to stop this.  None of them are heavily invested in Sunni Arab countries but they do want to keep the Lebanon-Syria-Iraq Shia axis from collapsing to chaos like Libya. The managed chaos policy provides ideological motivation for Russia and Iran to work closely together and challenge the US Empire.  Without it, they would not have much in common. Now the world can see when countries work together they can actually stop the US Empire. Regardless of Friday's attack on the Syrian government, the US Empire cannot win the Syrian war or overthrow President Assad. 

No doubt, managed chaos is adored in Israel and as I've said before when the US puts Israel first then it is putting itself in a weakened position.  Russia and China can bog the US down in the conflicts they create and the US Empire loses it's leadership role when it shows that it only punishes but cannot build and develop.  As well, it cannot make decisions for it's own benefit but instead is beholden to Israel. This is why Trump supporters are aghast at his quick reversal on foreign policy and how he has seemingly caved to the Neocons. 

The results of managed chaos:
1. Afghanistan - the US is bogged down forever
2. Iraq - the country was flipped by Iran to the Eurasian camp, specifically the Shia crescent sub-segment of that camp
3. Syria - united Russia and Iran. Showed the world how the US likes to play terrorists. Large immigration inflows to the EU. 
4. Libya - ruined the country and caused large immigration in flows to the EU. 
5. Shift toward nationalism in the EU - which will pull many countries away from the US and generally weaken the West since a united EU is a more powerful bloc than a disintegrated EU that is open to great-game style politics (openings for Russia, China and Iran to make economic deals and accumulate influence). 
6. America first mentality of many US voters and a sharp divide between the establishment (Israeli-first) and the population. 
7. Israel now has to face a strengthened Iran with GCC (useless Arab oil kingdoms) countries as "allies".
