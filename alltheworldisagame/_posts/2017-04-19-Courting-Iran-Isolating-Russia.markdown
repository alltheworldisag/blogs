*The Empire's relationship with Iran*

It is remarkable to note that [Secretary of State Rex Tillerson today announced that Iran has complied with it's end of the Nuclear deal](http://www.reuters.com/article/us-iran-nuclear-usa-tillerson-idUSKBN17L08I "Reuters: US-Iran-nuclear") in a letter to speaker Paul Ryan:



> The Full Text of the Letter:
> April 18, 2017
> 
> The Honorable
> Paul D. Ryan
> Speaker of the House of Representatives
> 
> Washington, DC 20515
> 
> Dear Mr. Speaker:
> 
> This letter certifies that the conditions of Section 135(d)(6) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (AEA), as amended, including as amended by the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (Public Law 114-17), enacted May 22, 2015, are met as of April 18, 2017.
> 
> Notwithstanding, Iran remains a leading state sponsor of terror through many platforms and methods. President Donald J. Trump has directed a National Security Council-led interagency review of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that will evaluate whether suspension of sanctions related to Iran pursuant to the JCPOA is vital to the national security interests of the United States. When the interagency review is completed, the administration looks forward to working with Congress on this issue.
> 
> Sincerely,
> 
> Rex W. Tillerson

If the Empire wanted to attack Iran it would use the same false-flag method as in Syria but instead directed to alleged breaches of the JCPOA by Iran.  This option is now off the table. Despite the "review" of whether sanctions should be lifted and the rhetoric about terrorism in the letter, the announcement is a continuation of the Obama policy of rapprochement with Iran. If the sanctions are not lifted after the "review", then the Boeing deal will be cancelled and any future deals. Russia, China and the EU will benefit economically. 

It's a stunning reversal for Trump but not unexpected if one views the U.S. as we do in this blog - as an Empire.  The deep state of the Empire has determined during the Obama administration that Russia is a threat, a rival, and needs to be cut down.  It was decided to pull Iran closer and punish Russia. Now the policy continues under Trump despite anything said on the campaign trail. 

The policy seems rational unless you think the U.S. is a democratic country and the President should fulfill his campaign promises towards the people. The fulfillment of promises is a principle that becomes lost among the complexities of running an Empire.  Since the U.S. is indeed an Empire, the people should realize that their needs are not the first priority of the government.  The first priority is the preservation and expansion of the Empire. Two examples come to mind where the Empire's needs do not serve the peoples but are put first anyways:

1. The Empire needs reliable, cheap energy for its 100s of bases worldwide hence the Empire includes Saudi Arabia. The people of the U.S. are endangered by the radical Islam that is preached by Saudi Arabia, spread far and wide by their money fueling terrorism world wide. The Empire's needs have historically and currently taken priority over the people in the case of Saudi Arabia.  The Empire will not end it's relationship with Saudi Arabia even after the 9/11 terror attacks. 
2. The Empire needs money to fund wars to defend and expand itself. The people need the government to balance it's books to avoid the slow but sure degradation of the financial position of the middle class and further impoverishment of the lower class.  The Empire has won here too since even with record deficits the Empire keeps increasing the defence budget and preparing for more wars. 
3. The citizens of the US need good jobs.  The Empire wants to write the financial and trade rules of the world and influence others countries to follow them.  Free-trade, global trade, international financial systems and using sanctions as a weapon to influence are all things pre-eminent in the "mind" of the Empire. The needs of US citizens are routinely neglected as a result.

Referring to the relationship between Iran and the Empire as a rapprochement does not mean that Iran will be flipping sides.  It means Iran has played it's hand well and crafted a position that forced the Empire to avoid confrontation: Iran is part of the ground force against the Empire's out-of-control project ISIS, it is in an alliance with Russia and it is a lucrative market about to open to the world.  It has enough defence capability - with the help of Russia - to make invasion and bombing risky. The Empire has chosen not to confront militarily but it will keep the phony label of "state sponsor of terrorism" to justify avoiding lifting the sanctions that they promised in the JCPOA in order to keep pressure on.
