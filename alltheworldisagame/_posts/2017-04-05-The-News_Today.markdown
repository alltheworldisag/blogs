***Syria, heading towards a US invasion?***

The US Empire's invasion of **Syria** gathers steam. A push to blame an alleged chemical attack against Syrian rebels on **Russia** and the Syrian government is underway.  The real reason may be to justify more ground troops for an invasion. [US warns it may act in Syria if UN won't.](https://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=23&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiksZGO4Y3TAhVH94MKHXCJAVAQFghuMBY&url=http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FUS%2FwireStory%2Fus-russia-trade-claims-chem-weapons-syria-46594463&usg=AFQjCNEDyo703sIY1HimjOgHHZEezHxNAA&sig2=zeR8lzy1Y59CObvB-2b-Jw&bvm=bv.151426398,d.amc) and [We are compelled to take own action if UN fails.](https://www.rt.com/news/383608-security-council-chemical-syria/)  This is looking a lot like [Iraq in 2003](https://sputniknews.com/politics/201704051052330037-syria-iraq-idlib/ "Syrian Official Reminds of West's Claims Iraq Had Weapons of Mass Destruction"). But not so fast ... the US government does not always send straighforward signals - the CIA and Pentagon move in different and sometimes opposite directions and the White House may itself have different plans.  A false flag may be an attempt by the CIA to push the White House into action but that doesn't mean Pres. Trump will take the bait.  Some are suggesting that [nothing will change](https://sputniknews.com/world/201704051052326674-trump-syria-chemical-attack/) and that Trump is [too confused about Syria](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/trumps-confused-syria-views/) to take a course of action. Or even worse - lash out impulsively rather than strategically. The US still does not have good options - they can take Raqqa but after that what will prevent an Iraq-style insurgency that puts US troops at risk?  Unlike Russia, the US has no real (non-terrorist) friends on the ground but many enemies. Could the Trump presidency survive significant casualties and broken promises of not getting into another Middle East war? Just like in the prelude to the Iraq invasion of 2003, there seems to be no real strategy from the US, no discussion about what the plan is or what goals needs to be accomplished, just alot of talk and threats. Ominously, word has come that Pres. Trump seems to be [changing his mind on Syria and Assad](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/world/middleeast/king-abdullah-jordan-trump.html?_r=0). 

***Somehow, The Islamic Republic of Iran always wins***

Another member of the resistance to the US Empire, **Iran**, continues moving forward economically.  Yesterday deals were announced between [Boeing and IranAir](http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/409019/Iran-Air-Boeing-sign-16-6b-deal) and [Aseman Air](http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/412325/Boeing-signs-new-3-billion-deal-with-Iran-s-Aseman-Airlines) worth $20 billion - about 110 planes.  This follows [deals with Russia's Sukhoi](http://www.presstv.com/Detail/2017/04/01/516363/Russia-Iran-in-deal-over-12-Sukhoi-planes) for 12 planes and [Europe's Airbus](http://www.airbus.com/presscentre/pressreleases/press-release-detail/detail/iran-air-takes-delivery-of-its-first-of-100-airbus-aircraft/) for 100 planes. Talks are underway with Japan's [Mitsubishi for more regional planes](http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/412377/Talks-with-Mitsubishi-ongoing-despite-Boeing-deal-Iran-says).  Diversifying their suppliers for airplanes is smart - but one would expect that from a regime that has survived the US Empire's vicious attacks for 40 years.  How many wins has the Islamic Republic had in that span of time?  It defeated the US-sponsored Iraq militarily in the 80s, defeated the US politically, economically and diplomatically in the aftermath of the Iraq war in 2003, defeated Israel's military invasion of Lebanon in 2006 via it's proxy Hizbullah and is currently helping to defeat the US Empire in Syria along with Russia. Who else has a track record like this?  No wonder Russia and Iran are Enemy #1 and 2 in the mainstream Western media.

If these deals with Boeing are accepted by Pres. Trump, then that's the end of the idea of economically isolating Iran - and a serious blow to Trump's campaign promises. Why would any other country hesitate to do business with Iran if the US is willing to strike billion dollar contracts?  And how will Iran pay Boeing without being re-connected to the Western financial system? Prediction: the floodgates of foreign investment are about to open.
