**Defining the US Empire**

![US Empire](../assets/US_Empire.png)

What is the difference between a country, a coalition of countries and an Empire? I assert in this blog that the US is an Empire and I would like to provide some definition so that the term has meaning and is not considered a slander or insult by readers of the blog. 

<!--excerpt-->

*What is a country?*

I believe a country is a political entity that usually encompasses one or maybe two distinct languages and/or races.  France is the homeland of French-speaking people, Spain for Spanish speaking people, Russia for Russia-speaking people etc.  In some countries there are minorty languages or races. For example, the US has a large minorty of english-speaking black people and Spanish-speaking latinos.  Canada has a large minorty of French-speaking people. Minorities do not generally change the essential race/language within the political borders of a country.  The US is still a "white" country despite millions of Black and Spanish people because these non-whites hold no power at the highest levels. 

Aside from race and linguistics, defense and borders also define a country. 

Economics and finances. 

*Is the US a country?*

If the US were just a country, it would defend only it's borders.  If it were in a coalition - say, for example the "West" - then it would supply and support other Western nations.  The US is an Empire because it has boots on the ground in the form of military bases that essentially garrison the globe.  The US spends more time, energy and money defending the borders of it's empire and trying to expand them than it does the borders of the US country.  Currently the US is trying to expand it's Empire into Syria and Ukraine.  These are wars of conquest regardless of what anybody says. 

How it sees itself.  Ideology.  Countries do not necessarily need to adhere to an ideology - they can survive on nationalism and patriotism and nativism.  Empires needs ideology. 

The West never wanted to give up it's empires.  It was forced to by Germany.  Keeping Germany neutered is essential for the US Empire to continue building it's empire.  

Why do people complain that the US gov't is an enemy of it's peope - whey did populsim rise in the US and Europe?  Because the West is under the US Empire.  Empires think in terms of their own power and advancing that power.  The Empire needs cheap labour - so the borders must be open - the native born be damned.  The Empire needs the US dollar as a reserve currency to enable it to simply print money to run it's 800 bases - so they keep client states like Saudi Arabia in order to keep oil sold in US dollars and provide an locked-in supply of oil for those bases. 

Being an empire leads to logical inconsistencies - supporting Al-qaeda in order to take Syria into the Empire.
