*China's Strategy*

Recent movements by the US and Russia in Syria present opportunities and challenges for China.  First I'll explore the overview of the chessboard before describing how recent moves affect the major players and China's likely goals,responses and strategy. 

Russia has emerged as a military power that rivals the American Empire in technology and sophistication.  Russia has also shown by it's moves in Syria and Ukraine that it is willing to take the risk of confronting the Empire militarily while protecting its own interests.  Russia cannot be an Empire even if it wanted to because of it's relatively small economy (about the size of Germany).  It builds coalitions to protect it's interest through military cooperation and sales of defense equipment.  From this perspective, one goal of the recent strike by the Empire with 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles on a Syrian air base was clearly to show that the Empire can penetrate airspace guarded by Russia's S-400 anti-aircraft systems - in case any country was considering buying them as a means of defense against the Empire.

China is also not an Empire and cannot put together alliances and coalitions to defend it's national interest through military cooperation because it does not possess technology like Russia and the Empire have.  China is instead an economic power.  It's economic clout is akin to Russia's military power.  Chinese moves to advance it's interests and compete with the Empire usually come in the economic field.  

China is a mercantilist nation.  It's aim is profit and prosperity in all its transactions. China eschews war as it is not profitable.  With its One Belt One Road (OBOR) project China aims to take its economic achievements viz a viz it's trade relationship with the US to a higher, post-US plane.  China's goal is to invest in Eurasian infrastructure and make inter-Eurasion trade at least as important as China-US or China-EU trade.  As such, China wants to be seen as benevolent and unbiased, with its OBOR project "[delivering benefits to the world](http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0416/c90000-9203447.html "People Daily")". 

It is logical then for China to keep out of military conflicts in Syria and Ukraine.  As well, China does not currently support the inclusion of Iran in the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO)  probably because it does not want to be seen as entering an alliance with Russia and Iran against the Empire.  Having such a reputation would not fit with and indeed harm its global trade agenda. 

Predictably, China had no response to the rudeness of President Trump's ordering the missile strike on Syria when President Xi was visiting Washington.  Instead, Chinese editorials praised the meeting as productive and evidence of cooperation between China and the US.  This image of cooperation is vital to China's strategy.  

Together, China and Russia do form a considerable threat to the position of the Empire on the global chessboard since one is a military giant and the other an economic giant.  Under Obama, the Empire decided to attack Russia by wresting Ukraine out of it's sphere of influence and imposing sanctions. Trump's election at first signalled a change in strategy; the Empire would make friends with Russia and attack China economically by threatening trade wars.  This fit with Trump and his supporters complaints of a lack of manufacturing jobs in the US and Trump's racial preference for white nations over non-white nations. The Empire's deep state seems to have conviced Trump otherwise and now Trump's foreign policy is a continuation of Obama's but without the former president's restraint.  

Under Trump the Empire launched an attack on the Syrian airbase, has publicly threatened Iran and Russia and made pubic its plans to invade Syria with ground troops.  Russia has responded by holding firm to its position in Syria, its alliance with Iran and verbally battling the Empire for the moral highground in the conflict.  

What is China's response?  Given China' strengths and strategy, getting involved militarily in Syria or even seeming to support one side would endanger its vital trade interests.  China's response is to continue promoting OBOR and generally global free trade.  Todays editorial in the state mouthpiece The People "[The U.S. should get more buddy-buddy with China](http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0420/c90000-9205581.html)" says it all. 

China promotes a soft image of a peacful economic powerhouse.  The Empire, through its adventures in destroying Arab countries and its moral browbeating at the hands of Russia (see Tillerson in Russia) is busy ruining its own repuation.  This is an opportunity for China to push OBOR and effectively say to the world that the Empire only ruins but does not build.  China does, via OBOR.  Similarly, the Empires missteps in the Middle East have given Russia an opening to say to the world that they can protect threatened states against the Empire militarily.  This is why it is so important to the Empire to sign TPP to prove to Asian countries that the Empire is still open for business (you'll see a push for Trump to flip-flop on TPP soon) and for the Empire to defeat Russia in Syria.  If these two things do not happen the Empire will lose big pieces on the global chessboard.  

China is under no illusions that it's friendly, win-win economic position is reciprocated by the Empire.  The Empire has in the past twenty years tilted towards irrational behaviours and extreme attempts at hegemony and a paranoid way of seeing other nations. China probably appreciates the role played by Russia and Iran in keeping the Empire's military busy in Syria and Ukraine.  Better them than China having to confront the Empire when it tries to stir up Sunni mulsim extremists in China's southwest.  Russia and Iran are on the border between Eurasia and the American Empire - its better for China to keep the fighting there. 

Given China's economic strengths and its goals (OBOR, continued trade with US and EU) it wants to avoid any interruption in global trade and this position is clear from Chinese editorials and responses to flare-ups in Syria.  It also wants Russia and Iran to win in Syria but cannot get involved without hurting itself economically.  Perhaps the recent situation in North Korea (a client of China) can be seen as a diversion to help Russia and Iran. As well, China is probably providing finanical assitance to both countries clandestinely.  Although there is no proof of that, many things don't make it into the  news.
