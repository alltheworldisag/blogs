World Model:


1. The world is split into different political/military camps (economic camps are different):
US-Empire vs Russia-Iran-China
1. We can tell which camp every country is in by analyzing a) where it gets it's military equipment from and b) who it's largest trading partner is, c) who is attacking it militarily or economically.  
2. Conflicts occur at the geographical boundaries between these camps. Often smaller countries are fought over and forced or persuaded into one camp or the other. 
3. The camps are always trying to get advantage over the other and every conflict between nations is influenced by the two camps.
4. Conflicts are driven by ideology/beliefs.

Conflict model:

1. Conflicts consist of a series of movements by either side that occur in a multidimensional space. The dimensions are military or economic.  Media is not a conflict in itself and cyber conflicts fall under the military dimension. The movements are driven by ideology.
2. Propaganda is issued prior to a movement by either camp to prepare the way. Propaganda is necessary if there is a public that has a say in governance.  This makes dictators very useful to the camps. Public's also need movements to be dressed up as a "human rights" issue or something like that to assuage guilt and lend power to the ideology/beliefs. For example, the US has a very strong messianic Judeo/Christian ideology and therefore enemies must be caricatured into Evil villians for public consumption. 
2. Each movement is meant to decrease the power and control of the other side and/or increase the power of the camp itself. 
3. A response is necessary by the other camp. 
4. Conflicts run in stages.
