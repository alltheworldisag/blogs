<h2>Battleground Countries: Egypt</h2>
<p> Whenever a signficant movement occurs in the world such as the Syrian war, it shakes up the order of things or at least threatens too.  Usually these battles occur at the boundary between the US-Empire and it's rivals such as Russia. The countries being fought over by the major powers are referred to as Battleground countries. Some Battleground countries may be forced to switch sides or be compelled to remain on a particular side depending on how the movement ends.</p> 
<p>Clearly what we see now is a fight for Syria - the US Empire is trying to flip it to their side even if they have to kill everyone there and Russia and Iran are trying to keep it with themselves.  Syria and Iran have a longstanding partnership which includes arming Hezbollah as a proxy force to pressure Israel. Russia has a naval base in the port city of Tartous, it's only base on the Meditteranean. The battle for Syria rages and the outcome is currently uncertain.</p> 
<p>While the Syrian war unfolds, what is the status of other Battleground countries?  Are they wobbling in their positions, threatening to change sides?  Let's look at Egypt today:
Egypt was once in the Soviet orbit but since it's devasting wars with US/Israel in '67 and '73 it accepted defeat and flipped into the camp of the US-Empire.  Recenlty, when the Obama administration chose not to support the dictator Hosni Mubarak during the Arab Spring pseudo-revolution, Egypt has since drifted away from the US in spirit, although hard military and ecomonic links remain and no other power is available for Egypt to join.</p> 
<p>Egypt's response to the recnt US airstrike on a Syrian airbase was very telling.  Other Sunni Arab countries were quick to signal their allegiance to the US Empire but Egypt took another course.  Their delegation to the UN <a href="https://www.almasdarnews.com/article/egypt-defies-arab-league-condemn-syria-attack/">condemned the US attack</a> on Syria and called for an end to the war. The day prior to the US attack, when there was an alleged chemical attack on Khan Sheikoun in Syria, the Egyptian delegation to the Security Council did not condemn the Syrian government and Al-Ahram closed it's <a href="http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/262437/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt-says-polarisation-in-UN-over-Idlib-attack-hu.aspx">main article</a> on the issue with quotes from the Syrian foreign ministry protesting its innocence in the matter - clearly showing whose side Egypt is on. In the current political environment in Egypt it's hard to believe a major paper like Al-ahram could stray from the governments line. The regime in Egypt was signalling that it is critical of US policy and not aligning with US objectives. 
<p>A general theme in the news media lately is that Trump is trying to reset ties with Egypt. On Friday April 7th 2017, Trump met Egyptian president El-Sisi during a five-day visit. During the visit El-Sisi met with IMF and World Bank officials as well. Trump expressed his desire to improve ties with Egypt but it is the IMF and World Bank meetings that were most important to Egypt. The real position of Egypt is that it is begging for money and that is the first priority.  On the surface it seems they are willing to continue being subservient to the US-Empire as long as they get some finanical help but considering their response to the US attack on Syria, they are willing to stand independently too.  Perhaps they know that the US needs them for Israel's security and fears them moving to the Russia camp.  As it stands the threat of Egypt changing sides is a very low probability since their main concern is avoiding financial ruin. Once their economic house is in order, look for Russia to make a strong play to flip Egypt.</p>
