***Background***

The Muslim Brotherhood and other Islamist groups are a response to the backwards and repression of the Kings and Dictators of the Muslim World and the stagnation of the development of Muslim societies.   The Brotherhood represents revolutionary ideas about how Muslims should govern themselves, what kind of society they should live in and how the religion of Islam should guide them.  These ideas are necessary to break out of the centuries-old passivity of living under authoritarian regimes.  The Kings, Dictators and the US-Empire are frightened at such a conclusion since the awakening of the Muslim masses will reduce their power.  In the case of the Dictators it will eliminate their power completely. 

<!--excerpt-->

The ideas represented by the Muslim Brotherhood cannot be contained or killed. Muslim people will not give up their religion and enter into strict secularism because they are not at a stage of their development where that becomes a possibility and they want the opportunity to develop while incorporating, rather than sidelining, religion.  This will necessarily be a work in progress. 

The Islamic revolution in Iran in 1979 was the first such attempt of introducing religion into the state apparatus.  Turkey's election of Erdogan in 2003 represented the next major Muslim country to have an Islamist leader.  Tunisia's revolt in 2011 which placed a democratically elected Islamist government in power was the first Arab example of an attempt to develop a Muslim governing structure.  The Egyptian revolution of 2011 was a third example and would have led the way for the entire Arab world to revolt and emerge past the era of Kings and Dictators but it was decapitated by the West in alliance with those same Kings and Dictators.  Currently the Islamist that was elected President is in jail in Egypt and the country is again run by a Dictator. 

The King in Qatar is one of the few authoritarian leaders that seems to understand that times are changing and it is neccessary to support Islamist groups and eventually break through this era of Kings and Dictators. This is fundamentally where Qatar finds itself in trouble with both the Kings and Dictators and the US-Empire. 

Under Trump, the Empire has put it's full support behind Saudi Arabia and the UAE and set itself against the portion of Muslim people who want change - specifically Turks, Persians and some Arabs. (Though for cultural reasons many Arabs prefer Dictatorship). It is not just the Muslim Brotherhood and it's sponsor in Qatar that are under threat but all Muslim people, Sunni or Shia, who want to develop and grow as societies. What will be accomplished by the Empire so solidly pitting itself against Muslim people?

***Analysis***

It is fundamental to human nature to develop, learn and grow.  The Muslim world cannot do so under Dictators and Kings.  The drive to develop creates pressure from the population upwards to the leadership of Muslim countries.  By supporting the Kings and Dicatators, the US-Empire is trying to cap this pressure.  Will it work?  Trying to deny or supress human nature is unlikely to work.  

To even try such a thing displays the blindness of the US-Empire and the inability of the current President to understand the world around him.  The Empire is blinded by arrogance as over the centuries the West has become accustomed to doing as it pleases in the Muslim world and killing with impunity.  President Trump is blinded by his own ignorance.  The Empire and it's President see Muslims as backwards and as a lesser people; they are filled with rage towards Muslims since 9/11.  This attitude leads to several mistakes understanding reality and therefore leads to inappropriate strategies.   

The Empire over-estimates it's ability to control Muslim people and countries by under-estimating their capabilities.  The Iraq war in 2003 was based on the idea that the Empire could contorl the aftermath of that war which it failed to do, losing the post-war competition to Iran. The Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 2006 to destroy Hezbollah clearly under-estimated that group and caused a humiliation for Israel.  The attempt since 2011 to overthrow Syrian President Assad by training and arming terrorist groups (even the same group responsible for 9/11) has also been a failure. Even if one considers that the foreign policy of the Empire towards the Middle East may be one of purposely trying to destory countries and create chaos as revenge for 9/11, the Empire is doing a very poor job of managing the chaos which has lead to massive strategic errors. 

In 2000, the Middle East was completely under the tutelage of the Empire with one rebellious Dictator in Iraq and a non-aligned Syria.  In 2017, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq are all solidly in the Iranian/Russian camp and have been flipped away from the US-Empire with Turkey and Qatar on their way out too. 

Seeing Muslims as lowly creatures means that the Empire is not able to appreciate the truly revolutionary struggles of Islamists against Kings and Dictators. They cannot see it for what it is: the human spirit desiring to be free, indpendent and have the opportunity to grow however it chooses.  To see it like this would require that the Empire first see Muslims as humans which is not possible espeically under President Trump.  President Obama saw it and that is why he wanted to strike a deal with Iran - he actually wanted to pivot away from the Kings and Dictators and towards the Islamist governments of Turkey and Iran.  He was also willing - for a time - to allow the Dictator of Egypt to fall and be replaced by democratically elected Islamists. 

Currently the strategy of the Empire is to sponsor Saudi Arabia to create some sort of Arab NATO to face Iran.  This collection of Kings and Dictators (SA, UAE, Egypt and some less important countries) can never win a war (see the current state of the Yemen war and the long history of Arab military humilations).  Nonetheless, this is the new strategy of the Empire and it is worse than the previous ones over the last 17 years. One can be certain that in the coming years, the power of Iran and Russia in the Middle East will be consolidated.  This will dovetail nicely into the the plans of China to create a belt of trade routes connecting Europe and Asia.  The Iranian/Russian controlled Middle East will be pivotal to Eurasian integration.
