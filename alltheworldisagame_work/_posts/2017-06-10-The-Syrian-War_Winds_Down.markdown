The de-confliction zones initiated by Russia have remained in place indicating that all parties wish to see an end to the war. The Assad regime will stay, the Kurds will have a full state or autonomous zone, Iran and Russia will have a military and strategic presence permanently in Syria. 

The losers in this war will be mainly the ones who started it:  
1. Turkey will see a powerful Kurdish zone that will be a threat to it's security
2. Israel-US-Saudi axis will have to live with the reality of the militaries of Iran and Russia active Syria which was not the case prior to the war. This will severly restrict the freedom of movement of Israel - they won't be able to attack Lebanon or any other place whenever they feel like as they did in 2006.
3. ISIS will be eliminated but the frustration of Sunni Arabs in the region will not be. This will be an ongoing challenge to the state of Syria.  
4. Syria will lose in the aftermath of this war as the country will never be whole again. The areas along the Israeli border and the Idlib province will have to be brought back into Syria through a political process which may not yield a unified Syria. The Kurdish regions will not return. 
5. The US-Empire will gain a position with the Kurds in the North of Syria which will free it from having to deal with Turkey.

***South Syria***

In south Syria, the US-Empire is holding the Al-Tanaf border crossing between Iraq and Syria.  [Elijah Magnier ](https://elijahjm.wordpress.com/2017/06/08/isis-dropping-as-fast-as-it-grew-in-2014-the-us-begins-to-attack-isis-in-raqqah-whilst-iraqi-forces-advance-behind-the-american-lines/)has it that the purpose of this move is to force the Syrian Arab Army to the northern border crossing of Al-Bukamal which is an area that ISIS fighters fleeing Raqqah will have to cross.  The SAA will have to fight them and it will be bloody.  The US-Empire will eventually have to vacate Al-Tanaf due to the fact that it is surrounded on all sides including the Iraqi side by forces loyal to or allied with the Syrian government. 

Another way of looking at the situation is that the US-Empire may have wanted to [train Sunni Arab forces to strike northward from Al-Tanaf](https://southfront.org/strategic-implications-of-syrian-government-forces-success-at-border-with-iraq/) and try to take more of the border area including Al-Bukamal.  If that is so, then the recent SAA move to take Al-Bukamal would cut off the Empire's plans. 

As we have said in previous posts, the major players have reverted to their basic goals: 
* Russia: fight Sunni terrorsits
* Turkey: prevent Kurds from gaining a state
* US-Empire: protect Israel
* Iran: consolidate Shia power/stand up to the US-Empire due to their revolutionary ideology
* Syria: it's territorial integrity

The US-Empire has no serious strategy or mission in Al-Tanaf with respect to protecting Israel.  Trying to control Syria and Iraq and therefore mitigating Iran's presence in this theatre by controlling one border post is hopeless.  Consider that Iran was able to help build Hezbollah in Lebanon through all the years that it's mortal enemy Saddam Hussein was in power in Iraq and land routes through that country were completely closed.  

In the next few weeks or months we will probably see an attempt by the US-Empire to grab control over land in the area of Syria that is bordering Israel in order to create a buffer zone.  That would be the only worthwhile project for the US-Empire at this point aside from it's realationship with the Kurds. 

Regardless of the details of how the south of Syria winds down, it is clear that the US-Empire will not be a major player.  The four countries of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon will be connected by road at a time when they are all allies and share a Shia-muslim identity.  This is new in the history of the region and a major loss on the Middle-Eastern chessboard for the US-Empire as these countries are not aligned with the Empire. They are all a mixture of sovereign states and/or part of a military coalition with Russia. All states have armed groups that cooperate with one another: The Lebanese Hizbullah, the Syrian military, the Popular Mobilization Units (PMUs) in Iraq and the various arms of the Iranian military. All now have experience fighting alongside one another and all share a Shia-muslim identity. 

The strategic importance of this land bridge cannot be over-stated.  It will create an opportunity for the region to be the land bridge to Europe that is necessary for China's OBOR initiative.  This region may choose to integrate with that project and hence become a part of the Eurasian axis instead of cooperating with the US-Empire.  This region also includes massive oil and gas resources in Iraq and Iran.
