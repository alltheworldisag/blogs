***China's Strategy with North Korea***

North Korea is a client or pawn of China. [Similar to how Saudi Arabia is a pawn of the American Empire, North Korea is a pawn of China despite being disrespected and disliked](http://thediplomat.com/2016/03/why-china-north-korea-relations-cant-be-broken/). North Korea's strategic importance prevails. 

1.  North Korea has historically acted as a buffer between U.S.-controlled South Korea and mainland China.  [The Chinese intervened in the Korean war because they felt there was a chance the U.S. would invade China](http://www.cfr.org/north-korea/costs-benefits-chinas-relationship-north-korea/p30887) via North Korea at the time. The fear continued for decades until today.  
2. North Korea is able to do things - such as threaten the American Empire or Japan - that China cannot do by itself without risking it's international reputation.  China's ideology focuses on being the number one economy in the world and for that it needs to promote global trade which it cannot do if it is seen as an unstable, threatening country.

As a result, China may fear that ending it's relationship with North Korea may produce a unified Korea partnered with the American Empire and thus giving the Empire the ability to place troops right at the border with China. China sees what is happening to Russia and knows it's history and does not trust the Empire to be so close.  

Saudi Arabia is the ideological driver of Islamic extremism which in the end caused the 9/11 attack.  Some in the US may have wanted to punish Saudi Arabia but in the end nothing happened. Similarly North Korea can do just about anything without fear of repirisal from China including develop nuclear and other weapons and fire missiles here or there.  The mental instability of the leaders of Saudi Arabia and North Korea are from the same root cause - being spoiled pawns of their respective masters. They sometimes get out of control and create headaches but they do not present real threats to their masters - just other countries.  Saudi Arabia is a threat to Syria, Iraq and Iran and North Korea is a threat to South Korea and Japan.  Since neither China or the U.S. is threatened by their own pawns, they will do nothing about them.
