Donald Trump went to Saudi Arabia recently and [sword-danced ](https://i.cbc.ca/1.4125552.1495305137!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_620/usa-trump-saudi.jpg)and "[Orb-ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/22/world/middleeast/trump-glowing-orb-saudi.html)" with their leaders and sold them hundreds of billions of dollars of military equipment.  What did he think they would do with that money? Fight terrorism?  Since terrorism is a tool of the US Empire's global military strategy and means of attempted regime change in Syria, that was not a likley outcome. The military equipment is meant to be used against Shia Muslims from the Houthis in Yemen, to the Persians in Iran - especially Iran.  The Trump administration is filled with Iran hawks.

So the orders have been given: Saudi Arabia is to try and put together an Arab NATO to threaten Iran with and save US troops from having to get into harms away. Today, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the UAE and Egypt have all severed diplomatic and economic ties with Qatar, a small nation with a population less than Houston, Tx but sitting on massive oil and gas reserves.  Qatar's only land border through which it imports almost all of it's food is with Saudi Arabia and is now closed.  What was Qatar's crime?  It violated the unity of GCC states and more widely Arab states by openly saying it would like better relations with Iran.  Qatar is now being punished for that. 

Qatar hosts the Empire's CENTCOM and a small Turkish base.  Since about 10,000 US troops are stationed in Qatar, it is unlikely anything happens in that country without the Empire knowing about it.  The Empire knows very well what Saudi Arabia is doing and it approves of this pressure on the Qatari leadership.  The only way Qatar can survive this is to find other supporters that might intervene.  

The [response of the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs](http://www.mfa.gov.tr/no_-175_-5-june-2017_press-release-regarding-the-developments-among-saudi-arabia_-united-arab-emirates_-bahrain_-egypt-and-qatar.en.mfa) has been soft - just a call for a "swift resolution" a reminder that terrorism can only be dealt with through "unity" and "solidarity". Turkish foreign policy has been convoluted for some time but lately it is becoming exceedingly simple due to the rise of the Kurds in Syria and their support from the US.  Turkey needs to cut down the Kurds and that is their only priority. Although they would like to see better relations with Iran, they are unlikely to make any move to save Qatar.  They, like the Russians know that Qatar and the other Sunni Arab countries are on the US Empire's side and cannot be flipped away.  Therefore, the sqaubble between SA and Qatar is seen as an internal affair.  As the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov says, it is "[their business](https://sputniknews.com/middleeast/201706051054319507-lavrov-russia-qatar-middle-east/)".

Supporting SA to set up an Arab NATO to implement the Empire's foreign policy is in-line with President Donald Trump's priorites of avoiding US troop committments to the Middle East.  Trump launched criticisms of the real NATO - especially Germany - for not doing their fair share and paying more money for their security.  Trump wants to delegate and hand over more responsibility for security to other nations and therefore reduce the size and burden of the US Empire.  

Supporting other countries to implement the Empire's foreign policy comes with it's risks as well.  In Syria, the Empire tried to arm jihadis to accomplish the goal of toppling Presdent Assad.  Theses jihadis became ISIS.  These jihadis came back to bite the Empire in Europe and Britain. 

Now the Empire hopes to use Arab despots instead of jihadis to implement it's foreign policy goal of confronting Iran. It is ironic that this Arab NATO, supported by the US Empire, is entirely composed of dicatatorial regimes and is not supported by any Arab country that has regular elections (Tunisia and Lebanon) and is aimed at an Iran that recently held an election for their Presidency.
