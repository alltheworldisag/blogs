***What is Russia's Position on the Qatar Crisis?***

Russia may see an opening in this current Qatar crisis to increase it's influence and economic interests and perhaps gain leverage in it's ongoing row with the United States. Russia has many interests in Qatar:

1. Qatari investments in the Russian economy
2. Qatari co-operation in Oil and Gas. 
3. Qatari support for Islamists which may pose a threat to Russia. 
4. Qatari support for rebels in Syria - now a moot point as the rebels have lost. 

Qatar sits on a mammoth gas field shared with Iran. Like Iran, Qatar is a potential competitor in exporting gas to Europe. Qatar wanted a gas pipeline travelling through Syria to Europe which was blocked by Russia and, in part, led to the ongoing Syrian civil war.  It would seem that Russia and Qatar are enemies as they support opposing sides of the war.

Russia, however, follows the foreign policy of trying to turn enemies into neutrals so it would not be unusual if Russia saw this crisis as a means of improving their relationship with Qatar. Russia has strong relations with Iran, which is also a competitor in oil and gas so this issue is not a barrier to co-operation. 

Russia would benefit from seeing Qatar cut ties with Islamist groups since Russia sees no difference between Jihadis and Islamists.  The motivation for Russia to intervene in the Syrian Civil war was to keep Sunni Islamists/Jihadists from reaching Russia itself. Defeating them in Syria means not having to fight them in Russia. 

Russia would also benefit from Qatari investment in the Russian economy.  Siding with Qatar in the current crisis if they agree to cut or degrade their ties to Islamists would accomplish several goals:

1. Move Qatar from enemy to neutral
2. Reduce the power of Islamists and hence the threat to Russia
2. Generate investment in the Russian economy 
3. Split the GCC and weaken the US-Empire
4. Adopt the mediator role in the Middle East which lifts the profile of Russia world-wide

To support Qatar, Russia would have to find a way to mediate the dispute. President Trump's recent tweets blaming Qatar for terrorism have put the Empire in a poor position to act as mediator and have yielded that diplomatic ground to Russia. Look for Russia to step up it's diplomatic efforts with the UAE and Saudi Arabia.  

Once Qatar is in the neutral category then the door is open to shift it to the ally category by entering into larger-scale and more strategic cooperation such as in the field of NatGas development and export.  Qatar drawing closer to Russia would also strengthen ties with Iran and Iraq. What do they all have in common?  Immense natural gas reserves.  A NatGas OPEC might become a possibility - one entirely free from the US-Empire.  The Empire knows this and would not allow it to happen and it is unlikely to remove it's 10,000 troops from Qatar. We are getting ahead of ourselves here. 

The stories in the MSM about Russia hacking Qatari government sites and how that started the current crisis seemed far-fetched at first and just another example of fake news. However, in light of the above four points, Russia has much to gain from this crisis and little to lose.  If Qatar remains steadfast and breaks with the GCC, it comes into play as a battleground state and Russia and others will compete for influence.  If Qatar capitulates, it means support for Islamist groups will end, which is in the benefit of Russia as well.  If Russia did not conduct the hacking themselves they must be feeling thankful that it happened anyways.
