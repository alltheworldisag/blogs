**Background**

On July 29th, The US imposed severe sanctions on Russia which make it almost impossible for the EU and Russia to do business in the Oil and Gas sector. The EU is protesting the fallout of these sanctions on their energy security and the encroachment upon their sovereignty. The sanctions are directed at preventing the completion of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline - a project by Russia’s Gazprom with German, France and other EU investors.  The project creates a gas pipeline from Russia to Germany directly, under the Baltic Sea, that will by-pass eastern states such as Poland and the Ukraine.  

The US sanctions are brutal and direct: they outlaw any investment in the development of Russian energy exports to the EU. Consequently, if the sanctions are followed, the EU will be effectively forced to find gas from other sources.  Some have said that the US would like to replace Russia as the main supplier of gas to the EU but at a higher cost.  From the German perspective, part of the reason for Nord Stream 2 was to accept Russian and connect it economically with German industry.  In this way, peace between two rivals who fought each other bitterly in previous wars could be achieved by economic linkages.  These sanctions make that impossible and not surprisingly Germany is up in arms. 

<!--excerpt-->

The sanctions were passed with a veto-proof majority and with clauses that make it difficult for the President to withdraw any of the sanctions later. Congress and it's Deep State masters have handcuffed the President while saying to Germany, Italy, Austria, France and Russia (all proponents of the pipeline) that the US won’t allow Nord Stream 2 and that’s that. 

The EU may respond by taking the case to the WTO or imposing counter-sanctions but it is hamstrung by the need for unanimity among EU states and countries such as Poland (which is by-passed by Nord Stream 2) will always side with the US. The EU is in a weak position to retaliate despite German anger.  

**Is this a Deep State checkmate?**

Is this a well-planned checkmate of the EU and President Trump or has the Deep State over-reached? The Deep State may win this, but it risks creating a systemic rupture within the US-Empire. Germany and other EU states will have to consider how they can protect their sovereignty in the future and avoid getting into a situation like this again.  The Deep State (mostly Israeli) is all to keen to take sovereignty away from it's old enemies: the EU and Russia.  Germany has little control over its defence and now with these sanctions, little control of its economy too.  In this position it is not difficult for them to be pushed around by the US. 

In order to regain their sovereignty, Germany and Russia may have to come together in support of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).  China's BRI has been accompanied by financial infrastructure projects such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB).  This may be the opening for Germany and Russia to attain independence by developing their economies outside of the reach of US sanctions.  What would mitigate the effectiveness of US sanctions on companies that do business with AIIB for BRI projects?  The BRI and generally Eurasian integration is a large enough project that it becomes an alternative to trade with the US.  A company that does business with AIIB and BRI does not need to also have investments in the US or use US dollars. 

In order for this idea to take off it is necessary that the major countries on the Eurasian landmass should work together.  Recent US moves in the Middle East have pushed Iran, Russia and China together.  This latest move of putting sanctions on Russia (and effectively, Germany) will push them together as well.  The list of countries that resent the US and would like a way out of the US dominated global system keeps growing: Germany, Russia, Iran, China.  A powerful block indeed.
