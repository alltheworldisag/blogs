***What is the significance of the recent downing of the Su-22 in Syria by US proxies?***

The US has stepped up it's activities in the SE of Syria around the Al-tanf border crossing.  It seems a poor position to be in since the US is surrounded on three sides by hostile enemies and has no real ground force.  Some possible motives for the recent downing of an Syrian Air Force Su-22 could be:

1. The US is preparing for a wider war by it's proxies
2. The US is being vindictive 
3. The US is trying to force Russia or Iran to retaliate and therefore justify a ground invasion of Syria 

<!--excerpt-->

There have been four incidents in the past month around Al-tanf where the US-Empire has launched attacks on the government of Syria and it's allies.  On the surface, this seems to suggest that the Empire is serious about it's military intervention in Syria and is gradually increasing it's presence - sort of invading in slow motion to avoid being noticed by its own public.  It would be tough to sway US public opinion in favour of another Mideast war, especially since President Trump's supporters expected him to avoid such a thing. Invading quietly is not an effective strategy since the Empire's enemies (Russia, Iran and Syria) are running at full speed.  Even though there have been four attacks in the past month by the Empire, they do not add up to a serious barrier to prevent the Syrian government from carrying out it's military strategies considering the hundreds of thousands of soliders involved compared to the handful of casusalties from the Empire's strikes. 

In the case of the downing of the Su-22, the US failed to talk with Russia over the de-confliction hotline set up for that reason. Russia called it being "stabbed in the back".  Since the Empire is deliberatly firing upon Syrian government troops and their allies it may seem that they are widening the their role in the war.  On the surface that seems possible, but in reality the Empire doesnt have a ground force outside the Kurds in the North and therefore has little chance of gaining much ground. So 1) above is unlikely. 

But if Russia and Iran react to the attacks by attacking the Empire's military, then that would create an opening through which President Trump would be pushed into war.  That would put the President in a dangerous place politically since he will be vulnerable on two fronts: a) losing control of the war to the Deep State and b) his already weak Presidency may not survive Americans coming home in body bags.  

However, it is not likely that Russia or Iran will take the bait since they have nothing to gain from provoking an invasion by the Empire. Their best strategy is to continue what they are doing.  They have the initiative in the war and can concievably win back most of the Syrian territory with the exception of Idlib province and the Kurdish areas.  

Since Russia, Iran and Syria routinely destroy forces supplied by the US-Empire - this includes ISIS - it is logical that the US-Empire would start doing that to forces supplied by Russia.  The Russian side is probably already doing the utmost to attack fighters allied or supplied by the US-Empire and it seems unlikely they could do more. 

So we'll go with 2) above.
