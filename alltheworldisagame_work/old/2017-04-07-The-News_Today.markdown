*Syria: The Empire Strikes Back*

The propaganda began two days ago after the alleged chemical attack - blaming Russia and the Syrian Government with all the usual human rights terminology and moral condemnations which fits with the ideology of the US Empire.  The propaganda reinforced the attitude of moral superiority among the Western public and paved the way for today's military movement. It's done - the US-Empire has entered the Syrian war directly with a cruise missile strike on a Syrian military airport.  Prior to this movement Russia had control over Syrian airspace and the Syrian military was destroying ISIS/Al-Qaeda all across Syria and effectively the war was drawing to a close with Russia and Iran the winners. This attack did not necessarily open up Syrian airspace since it was a cruise missile and not a jet. <!--excerpt--> Russia's ministry of defence has responded by saying it [would strengthen Syria's air defence](http://eng.mil.ru/en/news_page/country/more.htm?id=12117678@egNews "Russian military: we will improve Syria air-defense systems") which may be a way of forestalling the next movement by the US Empire: fighting Russia for control of the airspace and then creating a no-fly zone.  MoonofAlabama has a theory that Russia is trading [West-Jerusalem as the capital of Israel](http://www.moonofalabama.org/2017/04/israel-just-received-a-huge-payment-from-russia-what-is-its-side-of-the-deal.html "Russia gives huge gift to Israel") for stopping further escalation since the Israelis/Neocon establishment is ascending in the Trump whitehouse under son-in-law Jared Kushner and throwing them some goodies might get a good word into Trump's ear.    
As proof of the [Neocon ascendency](http://www.unz.com/tsaker/the-trump-administration-goes-neocon-crazy/ "The Saker: Trump is going Neocon Crazy"), Axios among others are speculating that the [Kushner (Israeli) camp in the whitehouse is pushing out the Bannon(christian) camp](https://www.axios.com/steve-bannon-to-associates-i-love-a-gunfight-2347592148.html "Axios:  Bannon: I love a gunfight") since Bannon was taken off the National Security Council and rumours are swirling that he will be axed from the whitehouse. 

It looks like the Trump foreign policy is defaulting back to the Obama policy.  Obama kept Iran close, China even closer and treated Russia like it was pure Evil.  Trump is turning that way too. Iran is getting multi-billion dollar deals for airplanes and my predication is that a lot more is coming.  China is getting warm treatment after a bellicose start from the Trump admin but Russia is back in the crosshairs.  It did not take long to turn Trump.  The Amercian Conservative contends that today's strike in Syria will embolden war hawks and shows that [Trump will cave in to calls for "action" quickly.](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/the-consequences-of-last-nights-attack/ "AC:  Consequences of last nigth's attack") CNN is pushing the angle that [Trump supporters are abandoning him](http://www.cnn.com/2017/04/07/politics/donald-trump-syria-populist-support/index.html "CNN: After Syria strike, populist supporters abandon Trump at home and abroad") since following the Neocon agenda is against their America First agenda. I think it's too soon to abandon him but there is no push back from Trump.  I would imagine if he stayed true to his original agenda he would question the veracity of the reports of the chemcial attack and say that he will sit down with Putin to examine the situation.  Instead he is [considering sanctions against Syria](http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-04-07/us-preparing-sanctions-against-syria "Zerohedge: US Preparing Sanctions on Assad") - another jesture to satisfy the Neocons.

As it stands the Neocons continue running the Empire of Chaos.  Elijah J M shares his views on the [US-EU plan to partition Syria - rip the northeast off and give it to the Jihadis](https://elijahjm.wordpress.com/2017/04/07/europe-and-the-us-have-a-plan-to-divide-syria-but-not-to-halt-the-war/ "EJM: Europe and the US have a plan to divide Syria but not to halt the war") and, of course, continue to supply weapons and arms to them - same Jihadis that are [currenlty running amok all over Europe](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/09/29/returning-jihadists-leave-europe-facing-generation-long-struggle/ "Telegraph: Returning Jihadists leave Europe facing generation-long struggle").  

Let's close this section with a little perspective.  Peter Beinart's [new article in the Atlanic](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/04/trumps-establishment-approach-to-syria/522369/ "Trump's Establishment Approach to Syria") hypothesizes that 'outsider' Presidents get 'rolled' by the establishment early on in their presidencies because they lack the self-confidence to stand up to them.  Only later do they realize the establisment is leading them nowhere and then they push back.  Beinart cites Obama's troop surge in Afghanistan which contradicted his stance on the campaign trail. Later in his presidency Obama seemed to grow more firm (this author's opinion) : refusing American troops for the Syrian war. 

*What will Russia do?*

Russia has invested so much time and money into Syria, I can't see Putin walking away.  They may have to accept missile strikes occasionally like they did with Israel.  It allows the US Empire to say they responded to Russia's movements and thereby satisfy ideological needs and reduce pressure within the US Administration and apply pressure on Russia/Iran in the event they want to deal for an endgame. Perhaps that is the strategy: the US Empire knows that they have a losing hand in Syria and that Russia wants to finish things.  So they are threatening an escalation to draw concessions out of Russia prior to the endgame.  So far they got West-Jerusalem, what else? ... and how is this putting "America First"?

Overall I don't see how the US Empire accomplished anything with this attack on Syria.  Russia will respond to this movement by investing more in Syria's air defence - not just more but as much as possible I would imagine since now they have to consider that the US may hit any sensitive target accross Syria.  This makes Israel's air strikes more precarious as well. As Iran's economy expands they will be able to support the war in Syria indefinitely.  So we have a situation whereby Iran is strengthened and Russia is committed more heavily to Syria's defence.  If you support the US Empire, you must be wondering why the US keeps making movements that are counter-productive? My answer: The US hasn't had a winning strategy in the Middle East for at least 20 years but at the behest of Israel/Neocons it just keeps going anyway.  America First? I think not. 

*US Congress will stand down on Iran*

M.K. Badhrakumar has a [nice piece](http://blogs.rediff.com/mkbhadrakumar/2017/04/06/trump-tends-to-see-iran-as-a-many-splendoured-thing/ "Trump tends to see Iran as a many-splendoured thing") which echoes what I said about Iran two days ago and the consquences of their $20 billion Boeing deal.  He notes that the Republican congress has shelved their new Iran sanctions bill and is affirming that they will not stand in the way of the Boeing deal. This movement indicates a lessening of the conflict between the US Empire and Iran.  

*Whither China?*

China is the ultimate long-game player.  They don't take impulsive action and they speak softly.  When reading english-language Chinese news it is important to understand nuance.  For example, an [article from the People's Daily](http://en.people.cn/n3/2017/0408/c90000-9200216.html "People's Daily: Keep Syria process on track") - a government mouthpiece - speaks volumes but in soft tones.  The article states that China supports:

"conducting an 'independent and comprehensive investigation into all cases of the use or suspected use of chemical weapons' and coming to 
conclusions based on solid evidence that can stand the test of history and facts".  --> This means China thinks the attack is a false-flag but they don't come out and say it. 

China wants to "prevent further deterioration of the situation and thus maintain the 'hard won' political process to settle the Syrian issue". --> This means they are on the side of Russia, Syria and Iran since it was those three that achieved the 'hard won' political process. 

And the last statement of the article was given to the Syrian government: "Syrian Information Minister Ramez Turjman said the Syrian leadership was consulting with Russia and Iran on the response to the US 'aggression'.  --> Last sentence shows whose side you are on but the quotations around 'aggression' implies that they are not going to accuse the US of anything.  

Now that's wisdom. Confucius would be proud.
