The US Empire made it's move following a predictiable series of movements. A false flag chemical attack was conducted to appeal to the ideology that the public has been shaped to believe in: that the US is an exceptional nation, that it's job is to re-make the world and defend "freedom" and protect people. The ideology is false but it works.  Every people need a "group feeling" (umran - the feeling that binds them together) as Ibn Khaldun would say.  Once that feeling has been evoked, the people will allow and even cheer for a war and the killing of foreign people and there is no authentic public debate in the US media to allow for alternative outcomes.

After the false flag, military strikes ensued.  Not too serious, but enough to send a message that the US is threatening Russia. Now Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is in Russia to represent the US Empire's interests from a position of strength relative to before the missile strikes. But not yet real strength as the facts on the ground have not changed.  This is a predictable and natural course of events. When Barack Obama was president, he did not want to play this game. Being a dark-skinned man, he probably did not care for the idea of Empire at all as that is usually the domain of Caucasians. Trump, of course, will play this game. It is up to Russia to decide how it wants to respond.  

The US Empire has several interests: 

1) continuing using 9/11 and the War on Terror as a pre-text for destroying "rogue" regimes

2) continue destroying the power of enemies of Israel (Syria and Iran) 

3) building a gas/oil pipeline from Saudia Arabia and Qatar to the European mainland 

4) eliminate the threat of a re-emerging superpower in Russia. 

5) continue it's ability to use Sunni radicals to foment chaos and change regimes it does not like - a useful tool. 

6) Have Sunnis and Shias fight each other.

If it achieves goals 2-5 then it will dramatically hurt Russian interests. Syria and Iran are necessary for Russia to have a foothold in the middle east, keep it's naval base in Syria and have Iranian and Syrian ground troops to work with it's airforce to protect it's interests otherwise it would have to use it's own troops and risk being bogged down in war. Without Syria and Iran, Russia would have to vacate the Middle East entirely. 

An oil and gas pipeline would end Russia's dominance of the European energy market and also make it dependent on Ukraine for it's main conduit into northern Europe - a relationship that is in tatters.  Russia also has in mind to stop the spread and use of Sunni radicals - having it's own Muslim population, it does not want to see a Syria-like situation within the borders of Russia. 

If Russia chooses to deal, then it will have to compromise on some of these issues.  An alternative would be to call the US bluff.  Russia may calculate that the US does not want a ground invasion in Syria, that the US public will not want it and Trump will expose himself as a complete hypocrite if he does regardless of the severity of future false-flag operations. A Syrian war will destroy the Trump presidency.  If that is the thinking in Russia, then they will continue the current operation to retake Idlib and the rest of Syria and impose a military solution.  Then the US Empire will have to invade and in large numbers.  This is an awful chance to take with a completely unpredictable president in Trump.  

Russia may create a response by first looking at the weaknesses of the US Empire's position in Syria:

1) Public expectations of no further wars

2) An in-experienced President, in a poor political position. Probably more comfortable ordering missile strikes than a full-scale war. 

3) A poor military position in Syria (not much of the country is under it's control and it doesnt have any useful ground army that can coordinate with an air force).  The US will have to fight the Syrian army and Iranian troops not Russian troops.  Therefore, the US will take casualties while Russia will not.  This fact cannot be over-stated.  Iran, Syria and their allied militias are fighting for their lives, literally.  They will fight to the very end.  This is the opposite situation that Russia found itself in Afghanistan.  Now the religious-minded people willing to sacrifice all to win the war are THEIR ground troops, wheras all fighting groups allied with the US are only lightly committed. The Kurds have no use of any non-kurdish area of Syria and the terrorists will kill Americans before they fight the Syrian government. Perhaps this is what Rouhani told Putin when he visited last week.  

4) Inability to tolerate US casualties.

Russia may play for time, knowing that the US Empire has it's own internal troubles that may change the equation at some later point.  Turning the focus away from Syria and letting President Trump have to deal with domestic issues may provided a better position in the future. Also, putting the focus on Trump himself by proposing some sort of summit may put the US Empire at it's weakest position (2). 

Positioning for a long war and making public that position would strike at 1) and accelerate it's defense of areas it already occupies in Syria would strengthen 3).  Making the US earn through military adventures what it wants to achieve is a strategy that may pay dividends.  The US is vulnerable when it has ground troops in Syria. The same vulnerability as in Iraq.  Any muslim person may become a 'terrorist' and strike at US soldiers - Sunni, Shia, Kurd, foreigners.  They may even stop fighting each other. When casualties start coming home, the Trump Presidency may go up in flames (4) for starting a war is popular with the deep state but not the people.
