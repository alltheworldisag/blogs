The approach of the US-Empire towards the world and specifically the Middle East has shifted.  Wheras President Obama was restrained in dealing with Arab dictators, preferring to dabble in cooperation with Islamists, President Trump is supporting these dictators like never before - totally un-restrained. Trump also equates political Islam with terrorism and seems to have been conviced that organizations like the Muslim Brotherhood need to be eliminated. 

Part of this shift comes from the nature of Donald Trump: sudden and seemingly impulsive shifts pushed heavily on twitter and apparently without building consensus in the State or Defense Departments and more widely the National Security establishment.  Trump at first seemed to blame Qatar for terrorism on twitter, then we learn that [Secretary of State Tillerson is trying to de-escalate the situation](https://www.theamericanconservative.com/larison/tillerson-scrambles-to-undo-trumps-qatar-blunder/). Sudden shifts in policy don't work because there is a lot of preparation that is needed from a variety of government agenices. Sudden shifts indicate a lack of actual strategy.

Part of this shift can also be attributed to thinking among his Iran-hawk cabinet and the Deep State.  They are all Iran hawks, Islam-hawks and Israel-firsters: both the cabinet and the deep state.  They only good muslim to them is an obseqious dictator who will kill as many of his own as desired by the US-Empire.  Free-thinking people who may cause the Muslim world to develop and evolve are to be eliminated as they represent a threat to power in the region.  The Empire already tried to overthrow the Islamist President Erdogan in Turkey and would love to do the same in Iran and replace both of them with compliant non-democratic military regimes.  So what is the strategy to get this done?

In the aftermath of the 9/11 attacks the strategy we can discern in hindsight was to take Iraq and Afghanistan and have Iran encircled. This was the plan in 2003.  It did not work out because after the military invasion of Iraq, Iran won the political and diplomatic battle afterwards and successfully installed it's supporters in the Iraqi government.  Iraq was flipped away from the US-Empire and into the Iran-Russia axis.  This was a geo-strategic loss of epic proportions for the US-Empire.

The next attempt was to eliminate the Iran-backed Hezbollah from Lebanaon.  Then National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice was famous for her "birthpangs of a new Middle East" remark when commenting on the 2006 Israeli invasion of Lebanon.  It did not work out that way as Hizbollah was able to sucessfully defend itself and Israel had to withdraw.  The "birthpangs" were not of a new US-Empire led Middle East of compliant dictators but of the emergence of the new Iran-Russia axis in the Middle East. 

Next came the invasion of Syria by proxy:  The Empire used Saudi Arabia and Turkey to create and fund Islamic terrorist groups to overthrow President Bashar Al-Assad in Syria. This too has not worked out and the Empire has essentially lost.  Although it might try to cut up Syria into pieces, it will not depose Bashar Al-Assad, nor prevent Russia and Iran from establishing a permanent military presence in what remains of Syria.  As a result, Lebanon, Syria and Iraq are all allied with Iran, with Russia providing the hardware. 

Now the next attempt at breaking Iranian-Russian power - after failing three times - is to fund Saudi Arabia to do it by creating an Arab-NATO.  Where America failed (Iraq) and Isreal failed (Lebanon) and terrorists failed (Syria) the new strategy is to expect Saudi Arabia and other Sunni Arab states like Egypt to succeed.  The first step is to get all Arab states aligned - hence the pressure on Qatar to drop it's ties to Iran and to other Islamists such as the Muslim Brotherhood, Turkey and Hamas. 

All Muslim Brotherhood types (e.g. Islamists from Turkey to Tunisia) have to be opposed because Islamists are thinkers and revolutionaaries and they have an affinity for Iran rather than an aversion. Therefore, they also have a enmity for all Arab dictators - that is why they are hated so much by Saudi Arabia and the rest of the GCC. So the Sunni world must be cleansed of thinkers and aligned in a unified, slavish, anti-Iran alliance.  Then they will do what? Attack Iran?  
 
This fourth effort by the US-Empire to attack Iran and hence Russia since it is aligned to Iran, has further strategic implications. If they are successful in creating a Sunni Arab NATO, attacking Islamists supporters such as Qatar necessarily pushes Turkey closer to Iran since both countries have ties to Islamists groups and good relations to Qatar.  In fact, both countries have come out strong in support of Qatar after the GCC announced it's blockade. [Iran has been provding planeloads of food to Qatar](https://www.rferl.org/a/iran-planes-qatar-food-aid-blockade/28540876.html) and a review of the government friendly Daily Sabah newspaper reveals a distinct [pro-Qatar bias](https://www.dailysabah.com/op-ed). 

Turkey is already concerned over the US-Kurd alliance.  Turkey also knows it is no longer a part of the West or welcome in NATO or the EU.  Turkey joining Iran and Russia seems the logical alternative for them.  Perhaps one day they will consider joining the SCO.  Entering the SCO along with Iran would be an elegant way to enter that institution since both countries would counter-balance each other like recent entrants Pakistan and India. 

Aside from pushing Iran and Turkey closer together, the new strategy of attacking Iran through an Arab NATO has another flaw: Arab dictators always lose wars.  This is a Truth.  Arabs only fight well for Islam.  Without Islam they will not fight but run away.  See the long history of Sunni Arab losses under dictatroships.  The only Sunni Arabs that fight well are Al-Nusra and associated terrorist groups.  They are the Sunni equivalent of Hizbullah.  The only way Sunni Arab countries become effective fighting forces is if they can leverage Islam as a source of motivation.  Purging Islamists from Sunni countries will ensure many military losses to come.  I don't think that Iran and Russia are sweating very much after having faced down the US in Syria when they are threatened with an Arab NATO. 

Have a look at a [great article by the Saker](http://www.unz.com/tsaker/the-crisis-in-qatar/) which takes a similar angle on things as this blog.
